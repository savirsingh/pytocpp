# example by savir singh
# shows input being taken and being converted to integers
# also shows how integers can be outputted alongside strings in C++ (not in python, and therefore this script won't run in python)

a = int(input())
b = int(input())

c = a*b

for i in range(c):
    print("Variable 'c' is equal to " + c)
